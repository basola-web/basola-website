## ✨ This is what winners look like!

On 8 August we took first place at the national qualifiers of the **#iTwin4GoodChallenge** at Bentley Systems' Munich office 🎉 – including **€1,000 prize money**.

And it got even better: In the international champions final on 19 August ([here's the YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3MkNf4_vPE&ab_channel=Enactus)) we were able to impress again with **BASOLA**, taking **2nd place overall** and securing additional prize money 🚀
