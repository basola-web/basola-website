Our new project Basola successfully pitched to the jury of Enactus Germany and is now an official Enactus project! This means: Basola is no longer part of the Innovations Team but is now an independent project. It can now participate in Enactus competitions and create even more impact.

But what is the project actually about? In the coastal community of Ladrilleros, Colombia, there are two major challenges: plastic waste and expensive diesel. Our solution? A solar-powered pyrolysis plant that converts plastic into fuel — sustainable, local, and efficient. This helps reduce pollution, creates jobs, and makes the region more energy-independent.

Behind Basola is a dedicated team of nine students from chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and industrial engineering. With interdisciplinary know-how, we are developing an efficient, scalable solution that can also be used in other regions in the future.

And we’re getting started right away! On March 27, we’ll be taking part in the Enactus Startup Accelerator (ESA) and presenting Basola to a large audience. We can’t wait to take the next steps — stay tuned for what’s coming next!
