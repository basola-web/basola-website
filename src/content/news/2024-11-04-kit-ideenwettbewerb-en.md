On November 2, the best ideas of the 2024 Ideas Competition were honoured at the TRIANGEL – and we were right in the middle. Back then we competed without a name as “Solar Pyrolysis”. Today everyone knows: that was the birth of BASOLA. 🎉

## 🏆 What we won

- 2nd place overall – a strong signal for our approach.
- Valuable jury feedback, new contacts and visibility for the next milestones.

## 🙌 Congrats & thanks

Congratulations to 1st place: GoFizz (Oscar Streif) – the portable sparkling water maker – and to 3rd place: Interstitial AI (Jacob Piazolo, Jonas Müller, Linus Grimminger).  
Thanks to the organizers, jury and all teams for the inspiring pitches – what an evening!

## 💨 Why the competition mattered to us

The second place was more than an award: tailwind for prototyping, partner talks and validation of our use case. The mix of impact, technical feasibility and economic viability convinced.

## 🔜 What's next

- Build the MVP & run field tests
- Build partnerships for technology, operations & local implementation
- Prepare a pilot in an off-grid community
