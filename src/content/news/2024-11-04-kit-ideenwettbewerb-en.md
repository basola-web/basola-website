On November 2, the best ideas of the 2024 Idea Competition were honored at TRIANGEL — and we were right in the middle of it. Back then we competed without a name as "Solar Pyrolysis." Today everyone knows: That was the birth of BASOLA. 🎉

## 🏆 What we won

- 2nd place overall – a strong signal for our approach.
- Valuable jury feedback, new contacts and visibility for the next milestones.

## 🙌 Congrats & Thanks

Congratulations to 1st place: GoFizz (Oscar Streif) – the on-the-go sparkling water maker – and to 3rd place: Interstitial AI (Jacob Piazolo, Jonas Müller, Linus Grimminger).
Thanks to the organizers, jury and all teams for the inspiring pitches – what an evening!

## 💨 Why the competition was important for us

The second place was more than an award: it gave us tailwind for prototyping, partner talks and the validation of our use case. The mix of impact, technical feasibility and economic viability convinced everyone.

## 🔜 What's next

- Build the MVP & conduct field tests
- Establish partnerships for technology, operations & local implementation
- Prepare a pilot in an off-grid community
