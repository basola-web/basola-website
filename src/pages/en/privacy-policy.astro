  <h2>2. General Information and Mandatory Notices</h2>
  <h3>Data Protection</h3>
  <p>Enactus Karlsruhe e.V. takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with legal data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
  <p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
  <p>We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
  <h3>Note on the Responsible Entity</h3>
  <p>The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:</p>
  <p>Simon Langner<br/>Enactus Karlsruhe e.V.<br/>Adenauerring 7<br/>76131 Karlsruhe<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:basola@karlsruhe.enactus.team" class="text-[#FBC02D] hover:underline">basola@karlsruhe.enactus.team</a></p>
  <p>The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data.</p>
  <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
  <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent at any time. An informal email to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected.</p>
  <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
  <p>If data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right to object at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds or the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
  <p>If your personal data is processed for direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising.</p>
  <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
  <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
  <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
  <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
  <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
  <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
  <h3>Information, Blocking, Deletion and Correction</h3>
  <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correct, block or delete this data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose and for further questions on the subject of personal data.</p>
  <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
  <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases: if you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us; if the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and request the restriction of its use instead; if we no longer need the personal data, but you require it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; if you have objected pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and it has not yet been determined whether our legitimate grounds override yours.</p>
  <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from its storage – only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Collection on Our Website</h2>
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. They make our offer more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
  <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies.” They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit.</p>
  <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
  <p>Cookies necessary to carry out the electronic communication process or to provide certain functions you desire are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Enactus Karlsruhe e.V. has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If other cookies (e.g. cookies for analyzing your surfing behaviour) are stored, they are treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>
  <h3>Contact Form</h3>
  <p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
  <p>The processing of the data entered into the contact form is therefore based exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out before we receive your request remains unaffected by this revocation.</p>
  <p>The data you enter into the contact form will remain with us until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions – especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods – remain unaffected by this provision.</p>
  <h3>Request by Email, Telephone or Fax</h3>
  <p>If you contact us by email, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.</p>
  <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR), as we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us.</p>
  <p>The data sent by you via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete them, revoke your consent to the storage, or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular statutory retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

  <h2>4. Plugins and Tools</h2>
  <h3>Google Maps (with Consent)</h3>
  <p>This site uses the Google Maps map service via an API. The provider is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
  <p>To ensure data protection on our website, Google Maps is deactivated when you first enter our website. A direct connection to Google’s servers is only established when you activate Google Maps yourself (consent under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). In this way, it is prevented that your data is transmitted to Google when you first enter the site.</p>
  <p>After activation, Google Maps will store your IP address. This is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this site has no influence on this data transfer after Google Maps has been activated.</p>
  <p>More information on the handling of user data can be found in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#FBC02D] hover:underline">https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
